# A-Star-Path-Find-Algo-Python

#### In this project, *pygame*, *math*,  *PriorityQueue*   used for establishing the A* algorithm.

## What is the A* algorithm?
#### A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. 
 

## Setup
- Install require packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run  `python main.py`


## Output

## In A* algorithm, How to use - there are such steps :
- 1.Click any box for *start* position
- 2.Click any box for *end* position
- 3.Now, *left click and drag the mouse cursor* to draw the black border
- 4.Press the *SPACE* button and wait until the endpoint reach.
